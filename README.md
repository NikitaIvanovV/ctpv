# ctpv

File previewer for a terminal

![showcase](doc/showcase.gif)

----

ctpv is a file previewer utility for a terminal.

It was made with integration into [lf file manager][lf] in mind,
but I believe that it can be easily integrated into other programs
as well.

It supports previews for source code, archives, PDF files, images,
videos, etc.
See [Previews](#previews) for more info.

Image previews are powered by one of these programs:

* [Ãœberzug][ueberzug] (X11 only)
* [Chafa][chafa] (X11 and Wayland)
* [Kitty terminal][kitty]

ctpv is a remake of an awesome program named
[stpv](https://github.com/Naheel-Azawy/stpv).
stpv did everything I wanted, except it was a bit sluggish because
it was written in POSIX shell.
ctpv is written in C and is an attempt to make a faster version of
stpv with a few new features.

## Previews

Previewing each file type requires specific programs installed on
a system.
If a program is not found on the system, ctpv
will try to use another one.
Only one program is required for each file type.
For example, you only need either `elinks`, `lynx` or
`w3m` installed on your system to view HTML files.

## Installation

### Manual

If you are building from source, make sure to install these libraries!
Depending on your system, you probably will also need "devel" versions
of the same libraries.

* `libcrypto`
* `libmagic`

Install:

```console
git clone https://github.com/NikitaIvanovV/ctpv
cd ctpv
make
sudo make install
```

Uninstall:

```console
sudo make uninstall
```

### AUR

If you are an Arch Linux user, you can install
[`ctpv-git`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ctpv-git)
AUR package.

```console
yay -S ctpv-git
```

### MacPorts

With MacPorts, you can install the
[`ctpv`](https://ports.macports.org/port/ctpv)
package.

```console
sudo port install ctpv
```

### Nix

#### Nix package

```console
nix-env -ivf cptv
nix profile install nixpkgs#cptv # with flakes enabled
```

#### NixOS and HomeManager

If you don't need to call it directly and
just want to use it through lf:

```nix
programs.lf = {
  previewer = {
    keybinding = "i";
    source = "${pkgs.ctpv}/bin/ctpv";
  };
  extraConfig = ''
    &${pkgs.ctpv}/bin/ctpv -s $id
    cmd on-quit %${pkgs.ctpv}/bin/ctpv -e $id
    set cleaner ${pkgs.ctpv}/bin/ctpvclear
  '';
}
```

## Integration

### lf file manager

Add these lines to your lf config
(usually located at `~/.config/lf/lfrc`).

```
set previewer ctpv
set cleaner ctpvclear
&ctpv -s $id
&ctpvquit $id
```

#### Wayland

If you use Wayland, follow these steps:

* Make sure you use one of the [terminals that support sixel][sixel]
* Add following line to your lf config
```
set sixel true
```
* Install [Chafa][chafa]
* Add `set chafasixel` to `~/.config/ctpv/config`
